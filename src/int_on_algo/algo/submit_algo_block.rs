// So the setup will be thus:
// Anyone can create an asset, with this enclave address as the:
// Manager account - the only account how can change/reconfigure the asset
// Reserve address - where the created tokens go to (instead of the creator account). Transfers out of here are "mints",
// and transfers back to here are redeems. Freeze address - either this enclave or empty string. This account can then
// freeze people. Clawback address - either this enclave or empty string.
//
// Setting the reserve address to this enclave can ONLY be done if this enclave has signed a tx
// saying it's happy to accept the asset. Nice.
//
// So then the dictionary will be a list of INT vault tokens mapped to asset IDs. Now the enclave
// can search for transactions where it is the recipient of some asset, which will count as a
// redeem and proceed from there.
//
// The other side of the enclave can then use this address to sign txs to send the asset from this
// reserver account, which counts as a mint.
//
// Nice!
